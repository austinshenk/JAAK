On registration tab is where we will create teams. Bowlers and teams will be created at the same time.
We will only allow users to add teams that have aready been registered when they are in the squads table.

I've noticed that for some reason, the bowler table is getting cleared out randomly.
I think it's only happening at the launch of the program.
It does not happen every time.
